# Express ReactJs Authenetication

## üìÉ Description

Express & React Authentication System

This project is a full-stack authentication system developed with [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) for the backend and [React](https://react.dev/) for the frontend. It provides secure user authentication, including registration, login, and email verification, with encrypted passwords managed by [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) and [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) for token-based session management. [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) is used to interact with a MongoDB database, while [nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer) sends verification and password recovery emails. On the front end, React and [React-Redux](https://redux.js.org/) handle state management and user interface, with [React Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) managing navigation. [CORS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) enables secure cross-origin requests, and [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) protects sensitive configuration data. Web Vitals is also included to monitor performance, ensuring a fast and reliable user experience. This project is ideal for understanding secure authentication, API communication, and state management in a modern web application.
